# grbl_MOCMUS
This is a library made to control our own 5 axis CNC machine.


This library is based on grbl-Mega-5x version "1.1r" firmware (https://github.com/fra589/grbl-Mega-5X) which is based on the classic grbl firwware. A huge thanks to both these projects.



*What is "MOCMUS" ?*
MOCMUS is a team of 6 engineering students at the University of Sherbrooke who wants to build their own 5 axis CNC machine. "MOCMUS" is a french acronym that stands for "Machine-outil CNC modulaire de l'Universit√© de Sherbrooke". It would roughly translate to "modular CNC machine from the University of Sherbrooke". This project was realised as part of our school curicculum.
